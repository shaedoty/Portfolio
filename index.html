        About
      </h3>
      <p>I graduated with a bachelors in Art with a minor in Art History and still enjoy doing projects in my spare time. Most recently I was employed as a pharmaceutical lab technician. Web development has always been something I've been interested in learning. Once I decided I wanted a career change, I took a few free online coding classes. After giving it a try, I realized I really enjoyed it and wanted to pursue it as a career. I'm very excited to learn more about web development and collaborate with others.</p>
